This is a team based game, running on scala Lift 2.5RC5.

[The girls explain](http://youtu.be/_dHKlEpCxOk)

Once upon a time, there was a generation ship, going to war across the galaxy.

After thousands of years of transit, the humans had all died off.  Leaving, Red Dwarf style, an Artificial Intelligence keeping the lights on and a vast society of cats.  Those cats who couldn't learn to use a can opener died.  After generations, the smartest cats had learned to use the computers and fabricators of the ship.  They discovered what the ship's mission was.

And they did not want to die in a war.

Lacking fuel, but rich in time, they planned for the most efficient way to waylay and disable their mothership so that it could never fulfill its mission and come under fire.  Whenever their course took them close to planetary systems or sufficiently large asteroids, the cats would hijack the fighters from the ship's launch bays, slingshot off the nearby celestial bodies, and fire on the engines and drive components of the mother ship.

This bought them time.  But the Artificial Intelligence, which they could not disable for fear of losing atmosphere, would repair the engines.  An arms race began, between the cold calculations of the ship's sentience, and the cunning claws of the kittens.

Cats versus Battleships.
